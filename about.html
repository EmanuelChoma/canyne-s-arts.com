				<br>
					Art has always been a means of expression and freedom for me. The journey from a blank paper to a complete art piece is an adventure for the imagination, and to embark on that journey is casting away all burdens. It's to be free.
				<br>
				<br>
					As a kid in Primary School, our stationary included a drawing book and that was my favorite book in the world. I drew cartoons and whatever else I felt would look better in black and white. As I grew up, my interest in the pencil shrunk smaller and smaller and I became more interested in other things in my teenage. 
				<br>
				<br>
					It was in 2020 during the COVID-19 Lock-down that I picked up the pencil again and got into realism. I admired the work of other artists on Instagram and my spark for the art combusted into flames. From then on I've been exploring the type of art I wanted to specialize in. So far, all my artwork is black and white using Graphite pencils and Charcoal on white paper. I draw portraits of my clients. I also have UNCLAD ART, nude drawings. And bodyscapeÂ drawings.
